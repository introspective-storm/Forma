# Forma

A platform that provides a suite of intuitive tools designed for both data novices and seasoned analysts. Get help with cleaning, ad-hoc reports,
plots, and preliminary insights. Helping anyone in an organization quickly understand, explore, and start their next data project.

The aim of this platform is to allow data experts to quickly move past the boring bits and dive into what they were hired to do; while laymen can use
this platform to quickly generate reports and gain an overall understanding of the data without getting into the weeds.

### 80%

Roughly [80%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#22a55f186f63) of a Data Scientist/Analyst's time is spent on wrangling data. Once that is over, there is often an exploratory phase, where data experts really get to understand the characteristics and patterns
of the data, and even figure out key factors that would be usefull. Then, and only then, do data experts get to do what they are hired to do. Throw in ad-hoc reports and other
interuptions, we can see that there has to be a better way to make their lives easier.

Assuming the average data scientist had a median salary of [$108,000](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm), in 2023 and there is an estimated 202,900 or so Data Scientists in the US alone, we can estimate that around **$17.5 billion** was spent in data wrangling alone. This number will continue to increase as the demand for the field grows into the future. This figure doesn't even take into account all the Data and BI analysts out there either, who follow similar workflows.

### Everyone could benifit from data, but not everyone knows how

From executives to local team leads, everyone can see the benifit of data-driven decisions. However, not everyone is an expert in data, and why should they be? A great head of marketing got that role in the organization for a very good reason. That is their specality and field of expertise. Yet, it is clear that they can also benifit from data. Big projects can be handled by the data team (if the organization even has one), but what about smaller projects that would usually require someone from the data team to go out of their way to produce? What if the marketing team needs to forecast future sales of a product? To properly run a rigirous time-series analysis on that data would require someone who not only has a solid foundation in statistics, but someone who understands the context in which the data is produced. The context is clear for someone who is the head of marketing, but they may not have the statistical background. A quick yet rigorous forecast and a report might take away from the time the data team has for bigger more important projects, and if the organization doesn't have a data team, then it must find other ways to solve this issue. Or alternativly, they don't solve it at all, and just sit on the mountain of value they have with the data they produce.
